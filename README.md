Availability Manager


The goal was to build an Availability Manager to monitor the status of Virtual Machines. 
The objective of this project is to gain experience with several hypervisors and the corresponding management servers. Explored the ESXiâ€™s Java API by developing the availability manager to monitor the liveliness of VM on one of the hosts and restarts any virtual machines that fail on alternate, healthy hosts, using an earlier cached version of the VM.
